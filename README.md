//TODO Stack
============

Instead of a TODO list, this is a TODO stack. It is intended for multi-tasking during the work day, and keeping track of the stack of things that you're working on as more and more interruptions keep happening.

It is built using backbone.js and runs completely client-side using local storage. Add as many tasks as you like, and as you complete tasks, they will drop down below the folder into the task bin.
